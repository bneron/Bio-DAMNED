This a small automaton to prepare biological data banks to be ready to use by
bioinformatics tools. It is based on Ansible.

It is able to download a bank or genome, uncompress it if necessary, and create
indexes for a panel of bioinformatics tools like blast+, golden, bowtie2, bwa, ....
The system can be easily extended to new kind of indexes or sources of data.

# Requirements

 1. Ansible >= 2.1.0.0
 2. and bioinformatics tools needed to creates indexes
    * makeblastdb
    * goldin
    * bowtie2
    * bwa
    * ...

# Architecure

The playbook give you an overview of all banks you have configured.
Each role is matched to a bank. In a role we assign a predefined workflow
given the kind of data.
The workflows are designed in `roles/<name of role>/tasks/main.yml`
Two parameters must be set for each role:
* bank_src: the url where the bank/genome can be downloaded
* bank_name: the final name you want to give to this bank/genome
A tag is also associated with each role to allow you to rebuild only one
bank/genome, and of course you can add tags to rebuild a set of banks.

(_genome_ is formed of __one__ sequence, _bank_ is a __set of sequences__)
The workflows are designed with roles but lot of steps are common between workflows.
These common steps are found in the common_tasks directory and are included
in the workflows (AKA roles).

## Provided tasks

### setup_general_bank_tree

Prepare the file tree for the bank and indexes.

### setup_specific_bank_tree

Create the file tree for this bank
1. create the directory for this bank.
2. create the subdirectory `uncompressed`.

### get_data

1. check if data (basename of src_bank) is in the `distbanks` directory, if not then download it.
2. copy the bank in `uncompressed` directory corresponding to this bank.

It will uncompress data if necessary and rename files according to bank_name
defined in role.

You need to pass an extra parameter to this task. The extension `fa` if you work with fasta file
or `gbk` if you work with genbank files. For instance:

`- include: common_tasks/get_data.yml ext=fa`

### link_fasta

Create link in the general fasta directory to the fasta file in the fasta directory of the bank.

### blast2_indexing

1. clean the blast2 index links in the general directory
2. remove the blast2 indexes
3. then compute new indexes
4. and creates new links

# Provided Workflows

The diagrams of the workflows used to prepare the bank/genome are below.
* The ellipse box mean this step is in common_tasks, then it can used in different workflows.
  The description of this step is done in upper paragraph "Provided tasks"
* the square box mean this step is directly coded in the workflow, then it is specific to this workflow.
