This a small automaton to manage biological data banks.
It is based on ansible
It is able to download a bank or genome, uncompress it if necessary and creates indexes for a panel of
bioinformatics tools like blast+, golden, bowtie2, bwa, ...
the systems can be easily extend to new kind of indexes or source of data

# Requirements

 ansible >= 2.1.0.0
 and bioinformatics tools needed to creates indexes makeblastdb, goldin, bowtie2, bwa, ...: 
 
# Architecure

The playbook give you an over view of all banks you have configured. 
Each role match to a bank.
In a role we assign a predefined workflow given the kind of data.
The workflows are designed in roles/tasks/main.yml
Two parameters must be set for each  role:
* bank_src: the url where the bank/genome can be downloaded
* bank_name: the final name you want to give to this bank/genome 
A tag is also associated for each role to allow to rebuild only one bank/genome
of course you can add tags to rebuild a set of banks.

The worklows are design in roles but lot of step are common between workflows.
So this common steps are design in common_tasks directory and are includes in the workflows (aka roles).
 
## Provided tasks

### setup_general_bank_tree

prepare the file tree for the bank and indexes 

### setup_specific_bank_tree

create the file tree for this bank
 * create the directory for this bank
 * create the subdirectory uncompressed

### get_data

* check if data (basebane of src_bank) is in distbanks, if none download it.
* copy the bank in uncompressed direcory corressponding to this bank

it uncompress the data if necessary and rename files according to bank_name
define in role

### link_fasta

create link in general fasta directory toward the fasta file in fasta directory of the bank

### blast2_indexing

* clean the blast2 indexes link in general directory
* remove the blast2 indexes
* then compute new indexes
* and creates new links
